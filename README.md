# Bibliomancy

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill for drawing random Bible verses from the King James Version for divination or reflection.

## Usage

In Claude Code, run:

```
/bibliomancy
```

You'll be asked what section of the Bible to draw from:

- **Whole Bible** — all 66 books
- **Old Testament** — the 39 OT books
- **New Testament** — the 27 NT books
- **Specific book** — name a book (e.g., Isaiah, Psalm, Proverbs)

If you choose a specific book, you'll be prompted to enter the book name. A random verse from your chosen section is then drawn and presented.
